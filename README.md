# NielsPeeters_Web_App_From_Scratch
 Simple web app that connects a API, retrieves data with javascript, and displays it on the front end of the website. The goal is to learn javascript syntaxes, datatypes and basic knowledge of working with JSON and javascript objects.

Objective:

I want to get the data for all Studio Ghibli films and display the titles and descriptions in a grid.

Finished the first task where we had to connect a API with our website. The second task is to add modules and routes to construct your code, besides that I fixed some issues my teammates made within my code. I'm currently developing routes with routie and trying to use only 1 server request.
